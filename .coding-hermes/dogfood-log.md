# Guard dogfood log

## 2026-10-02 — first dogfood run (tick guard-dogfood-2026-10-02-02-20-45)

- **Verdict: PROMISING-BUT-ROUGH** — core classification works end to end in
  all three consumption shapes; trust/usability edges need work.
- **Promise:** classify untrusted messages for prompt injection via CLI /
  HTTP / Python connector with one shared verdict contract. **Reality:** held
  up — same Result from all three; direct, ROT13 and base64 injection all
  blocked at 0.98, benign delivered.
- **Time-to-first-success:** ~15 min (binary builds in seconds; the wait was
  credential loading, which is undocumented — GUARD-DF-003).
- **Top findings:** GUARD-DF-001 (P1: fail-open outage strips tools/secrets
  via constraints={}), GUARD-DF-002 (P2: normalizations field misdocumented,
  rot13 on every result), GUARD-DF-003 (P2: no quickstart, prereqs
  undocumented). GUARD-001 corroborated live pre-fix, fix verified post-fix
  on the fresh box.
- **Install leg:** ran on ephemeral bunker agent (las-bunker-03, destroyed
  after). Fresh Debian 13: go build 15.5s cold, vet clean, tests pass,
  headline feature identical to dev box. Install friction = undocumented
  prereqs, not broken code.
- **Perf:** CLI 293–327ms warm / 260ms HTTP / 0.25–0.9s cold — provider-bound
  (Jev API); no PERF row (nothing locally slow enough to feel).
- **Left behind:** docs/dogfood/2026-10-02-integration.md,
  docs/dogfood/diagnostics.md, skills/guard-usage/SKILL.md, 3 new board rows
  + GUARD-001 cross-evidence note.

## 2026-10-13 — dogfood run 2 (tick guard-dogfood-2026-10-13-14-52-46, READ-ONLY lane)

- **Verdict: SOUND** — all three consumption shapes re-proven at HEAD b23aad1;
  new surface this run = HTTP auth/error paths, Go library consumer, Python
  connector on a fresh box.
- **Install leg:** PASS on bunker-mvp agent guard-dogfood (las-bunker-03 +
  bunker2/3/4 unreachable over tailscale; single live host suffices per skill).
  Clone→build 33s (go 1.26.6 auto-download)→fail-closed first run rc=2→tests
  green→pip connectors/python→guard CLI works. ~3min cold; agent destroyed,
  residue re-checked (none).
- **Findings (SUGGESTED, not filed — lane is read-only):** DF-G1 {input} vs
  {content} doc bug in main.go:7; DF-G2 raw decode-error leak; DF-G3 CLI stdin
  unbounded ReadAll vs 8MiB HTTP cap; DF-G4 >8MiB 400 message lacks the limit;
  DF-G5 truncated mq-01 example in threshold-calibration.md. Full evidence:
  docs/dogfood/2026-10-13-run2-findings.md (commit c1fa6eb).
- **Perf:** HTTP 394ms±13 warm (provider-bound); CLI 638ms±112 (same Jev floor);
  local path 4-8ms. No PERF row — nothing locally slow enough to feel.
- **Board note:** tasks.jsonl tail shows DOC-2..DOC-10 'done' rows duplicating
  earlier 'pending' rows for the same ids (52 lines, dup-id pairs DOC-2/6/7/8/10,
  README-2..6) — status-by-id is ambiguous; foreman should reconcile.
